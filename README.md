# python-rps
Simple rock-paper-scissors algorithm in Python

This is not good code. It contains the remnants of many failed amateur data analysis ideas, none of which are properly documented.
I didn't really intend for it to be shared. Please do not try to use it.

rps.py and rpssmooth.py are where the action is, not main.py. clausen.py and clausen-polylog.py approximate the [Clausen function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausen_function).
